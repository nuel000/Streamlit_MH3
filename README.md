# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-App-Deployment

This web App deploys a trained Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies

This web app classifies wether or not a person believes climate change is caused by man-kind.
It classifies tweets or texts regarding climate change into 4 major classes:

- **2 (News)** : the tweet links to factual news about climate change
- **1 (Pro)** : the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change
- **0 (Neutral)** : the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change
- **-1 (Anti)**: the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change Variable definitions
